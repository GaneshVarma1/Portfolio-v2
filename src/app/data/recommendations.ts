    fullContent: "I had the pleasure of working closely with Sri from February â€“ June 2025, when he joined DocNexus on a fixed-term contract as a Full-Stack Developer. In just four months he delivered results that many teams would schedule across two full quarters.\n\nâ¸»\n\nProject Highlights\n\n1. AI-Enabled Next.js Platform\nâ€¢ Designed and shipped a green-field web application that became the internal benchmark for future DocNexus products.\nâ€¢ Implemented a conversational AI chat interface with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Users can ask questions, drill into source documents, and receive concise, context-aware answersâ€”significantly reducing the time our analysts spend searching for information.\nâ€¢ Orchestrated multiple AI providers (OpenAI and open-source models) behind a unified abstraction layer, giving us cost/latency flexibility with zero vendor lock-in.\n\n2. Search & Performance Architecture\nâ€¢ Built an ElasticSearch experience, and tuned analyzers for medical terminology that improved first-result relevance from ~60% to 94% (measured with our in-house relevance test suite).\nâ€¢ Introduced a multi-tier caching strategy (HTTP CDN, Redis edge cache, and client-side SWR hooks) that pushed P95 end-to-end response times below 150 ms.\n\n3. Frontend Excellence\nâ€¢ Created a reusable design system with Tailwind + Radix + shadcn/ui, covering typography, theming, and responsive layouts. Our designers now prototype twice as fast thanks to these ready-made components.\nâ€¢ Paid meticulous attention to accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA), keyboard navigation, and motion preferencesâ€”ensuring our platform is inclusive by default.\n\nâ¸»\n\nTechnical & Soft Skills\nâ€¢ Breadth + Depth: Equally comfortable wiring GraphQL resolvers, tuning ElasticSearch queries, or finessing micro-interactions in React.\nâ€¢ Creative Problem Solver: When third-party RAG libraries fell short, he wrote a custom chunk-ranking algorithm that boosted summary accuracy without increasing token spend.\nâ€¢ Code Quality Advocate: Set up ESLint, Prettier, and Vitest tests in CI, driving a culture of clean, tested code.\nâ€¢ Ownership Mindset: Treated the project like a product, not a contract gig. He documented architecture decisions, onboarded a junior engineer, and even drafted the post-launch monitoring runbook.\n\nâ¸»\n\nImpact\n\nSri's blend of user-centric design sense and state-of-the-art AI engineering is rareâ€”and in high demand. He left us with a scalable foundation that continues to power new features long after his contract ended. I have zero doubt he will bring the same drive, creativity, and technical rigor to any future team.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Sri to organizations aiming to ship beautiful, AI-native user experiences. Feel free to message me if you'd like more detail on his contributions.",
